# Text Font Formatter Project

Welcome to the Text Font Formatter project! This project showcases my skills in building a web application that allows users to format text with different fonts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application leverages the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the user interface and provide a seamless experience for users.

## Project Overview

The Text Font Formatter application provides the following features:

- Input text area to enter text
- Font selection dropdown to choose different fonts
- Formatting button to apply the selected font to the input text
- Formatted text area to display the transformed text with the selected font

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with Google Fonts integration

To run the Text Font Formatter project locally, follow these steps:

## Features and Usage

1. Enter your desired text in the "Enter Your Text" textarea.
2. Choose a font from the dropdown list.
3. Click the "Click Me!" button to apply the selected font to the text.
4. The formatted text will appear in the "The Formatted Text is:" textarea.
