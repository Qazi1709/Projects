# Chronometer Project

Welcome to the Chronometer project! This project showcases my skills in building a chronometer (stopwatch) web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to provide interactive functionality.

## Project Overview

The Chronometer project includes the following features:

- Start, stop, and reset buttons for controlling the chronometer.
- Stylish and responsive design created with CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
