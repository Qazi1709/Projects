# Task App Project

Welcome to the Task App project! This project demonstrates my skills in building a full-stack web application using Node.js, Express.js, ReactJs, MongoDb, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), authentication middleware, and interactive features for the Front End.

The Task App provides the following features:

- User registration and login using JWT for authentication
- CRUD operations for managing tasks:
  - Create new tasks
  - Read existing tasks
  - Update task status
  - Delete tasks
- Secure API routes using authentication middleware
- Interactive command-line interface for task management on the client side

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End (Client Side):** ReactJs and Tailwind Css
- **Back-End (Server Side):** Node.js, Express.js
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database:** MongoDb
