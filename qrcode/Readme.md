# QR Code Generator Project

Welcome to the QR Code Generator project! This project showcases my skills in building a web application that allows users to generate QR codes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the user interface and provide a seamless experience for users.

## Project Overview

The QR Code Generator application provides the following features:

- Input field to enter text or URLs for QR code generation.
- "Generate QR Code" button to create the QR code.
- Display area to show the generated QR code.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- **QR Code Generation:** External QR code generation library (is used)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Qazi1709/Projects.git`
2. Navigate to the QR Code Generator project directory: `cd qrcode`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the application.

## Features and Usage

1. Enter the text or URL you want to generate a QR code for in the input field.
2. Click the "Generate QR Code" button.
3. The generated QR code will be displayed on the screen.
